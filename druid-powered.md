## Paypal

The Druid production deployment at PayPal processes a very large volume of data
and is used for internal exploratory analytics by business analytic teams. Here
is what they have to say:

> Around early Feb, 2014, the Paypal Tracking Platform team, lead by Suresh Kumar, stumbled upon an article talking about a new
> upcoming kid in Real Time Analytics world. After first glance it seemed just like any other
> new cool looking technology. But after reading little deeper into the papers(they had
> referred) and few blogs, it was clear it is different. The fundamental approach to query
> the data itself looked very different and refreshing.
>
> Coincidently, at the same time, the team was struggling to create a very high volume real-time data
> query system. We had already explored Drill, Hive, Cassandra, TSDB, Shark etc.
> Dating back at least a year, none of these technologies were fulfilling our low latency needs for very high
> volumes of data.
>
> So, as an option we started the Druid prototype and within couple of weeks it was looking like
> a very promising alternate. Very soon with great help from Core Druid development team
> our prototype was doing great.
>
> We then started the prototype with large 7-10 billion records and see the response time for
> query. It was quite amazing.
>
> Today our Druid implementation in PayPal processes a very large volume of Data and is
> used for our internal exploratory analytics by business analytic teams.
>
> The thing we liked the most was amazing support provided by core Druid team. I have never
> seen a Open Source Community providing such a very high level of responsiveness for ANY
> issue related to Druid setup and tuning.

## Wikimedia Foundation

We're serving pageview data via Druid and Pivot.  Our internal customers are loving it and we're working on allowing public access to sanitized data, both editing and pageview.  We like Druid because it's open source, the folks that work on it have built a good community, and it's about five times faster than Hive for us right now, without any tuning or optimization (and the Hadoop cluster is beefier than the Druid one), just dumped lots of data into it and Pivot was immediately useful to our analysts.  We wrote a [puppet](https://github.com/wikimedia/operations-puppet/tree/production/modules/druid) module that others might find helpful.
