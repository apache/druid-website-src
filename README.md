Druid Project Website
=====================

http://apache.druid.org/

## Building

Setup (you only need to do this once):

```
npm install
bundle install
```

Every time you want to run the site:

```
gulp
npm start
```

## Notes

Ideally we would not be checking in the `css` directory and just build it as part of the deploy process.
