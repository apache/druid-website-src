# Apache Druid Community Event Guidance

Community events are a wonderful way to bring people together to share stories of success, to educate on features and approaches, and to meet like-minded individuals. This guidance is provided as a starting point for organizers of and speakers at Apache Druid events, intended to ensure everyone gets the most out of them, and has a great time while they are there.

This guidance applies to any event where Apache Druid is at the core - whether that's virtual or in person, whether it's for a local special interest group of 10 people or a conference of 10,000.

## Guidance for organizers

### Apache Software Foundation rules take precident

If you're an organizer of any kind of event where you want to put Apache Druid front-and-center, take care to read the Apache Software Foundation's own [event](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/events) and trademark policies. These are the foundation of many of the principles below.

Some points of note:

* The Apache software foundation has [strict rules](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/) when Apache trademarks are used. You must seek approval [when the event name or primary branding features Apache marks](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/events#events) - and that includes Apache Druid. And you must make sure you [refer to Apache marks, projects, and products](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/events#naming) appropriately in materials, and include a clear attribution statement.

* All Apache Druid Meetups must respect and enforce the Apache [anti-harassment policy](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/events#anti-harassment). Everyone involved, including hosts, speakers, and attendees, must uphold and apply the policy.

* Lean into [providing education](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/events#education) about Apache Druid, rather than filling your diary with cool presentations about use cases.

* Find a local PMC member who can [represent the Apache Druid project](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/events#selection) (not their employer) and make sure your events are above board.

* Only use the Apache Druid logo to [refer to Apache Druid](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/events#graphics) - don't use it as part of your event's core branding.

* Always try to avoid [conflicts](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/events#dates) with other Apache events.

### The community is bigger than Druid

As an organizer of an Apache Druid meetup, you're part of a bigger movement full of cool and superb people. Take note of the ecosystem around Apache Druid and bring them along! Whether it's speakers or attendees, it's worth contacting other Apache meetups in your area. Remember that the focus of the event remains Apache Druid, so guide speakers to talk about how their technology relates to and works with Apache Druid.

### Give it some Slack

The community channels are a great place to share details of your event ahead of time. Be specific about the time, date, and location, and about the topics and speakers.

Never spam.

And there are other Druid meetup groups out there! For example, check out the list on meetup.com - some cross-promotion is always good.

### Select speakers based on merit

It can be very tempting to invite (or accept!) speakers because they're a big draw or have something cool to say. Or maybe they're promising to buy everyone who comes along a new car! But resist the temptation: as an organizer, it's your responsibility to put the Druid community first, not the speaker.

* Consider having multiple organizers so you can reach consensus on the event agenda, including that all-important PMC member. This is an absolute requirement for large-scale events - see the Apache rules.

* Invite and accept speaker submissions based on their merit.

> Merit [lies with the individual](https://www.apache.org/theapacheway/#what-makes-the-apache-way-so-hard-to-define), does not expire, and is not influenced by employment status or employer.
> 
> Individuals participate at the Apache Software Foundation, not organizations. Domain expertise is appreciated; Benevolent Dictators For Life are disallowed.


## Guidance for speakers

### Be a speaker, not a seller
The best meetups are where people learn and see what they can do thanks to the FOSS movement. They are not a place to find suspects, prospects, or to update customers for commercial products - nor are they the place to say that your solution is the best, and everyone else is the worst!

Just like the Apache Software Foundation itself, Druid events must be [vendor neutral](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/#rationale).

Amongst other things:

* Content which is solely focused on promotion of a product or service is never permitted at an Apache Druid event.
* It’s okay to mention and show commercial products when they are a key part of your Apache Druid-powered solution, but - because you're an educator! - it must always work with a truly free version of the commercial product.
* Attendees must never feel compelled to provide their personal data for pipeline generation.
* Let your company's technical expertise and integrity shine through your speaker: Druid events aren't a place for reciting battle cards or to have your speaker trained up and ready to go with objection handling narratives.

### Respect the part we all play

Never claim to be the [sole or exclusive leaders](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/events#events) of the Apache Druid project, nor the sole source of information. And never imply ownership, endorsement, or sponsorship of any ASF-related project or initiative of any kind.

> "No organization is able to gain special privileges or control a project’s direction, irrespective of employing Committers to work on Apache projects or sponsorship status."

> "Benevolent Dictators For Life are [disallowed](https://www.apache.org/theapacheway/#important)."

Never leave your audience believing that, somehow, you are speaking on behalf of the project or its community. Instead of saying something like, "in two years time, we will have support for ingestion from AcmeSQLDB," make a distinction between you / your team and the project: "the team here at Mafflin, Mifflin, Mofflin, and Mufflin are working on ingestion into Apache Druid from AcmeSQLDB! And we plan to contribute that to open source in the next two years."

When you use the Apache Druid logo or name (or any Apache marks) make sure your audience won't get confused between Apache projects and someone else's products or service. For example, don't mix and match corporate logos on the same slides.

### Respect the family

Keep your talk unbiased and educational. Engineers who create open source software - whoever they are - are our friends!

Never disparage the ASF, its projects, members, sponsors, or communities - whether that's in your talk ("Demonstrating how bad MufflinTSDB is compared to Apache Druid") or in how you reply to questions ("Oh yeah, we tried MofflinMofflinDB and it was AWFUL!") Stay objective, and lean into technical comparisons whenever you can. "MifflinMifflinDB has a centralized PotatoMasher process, while Apache Druid has a pool of StarchCompressor processes that handle things differently."

### Stay on topic

The focus of your talk must be Apache Druid.

Sharing technical information about another technology is not just awesome education, it's also sometimes necessary to give context.  Just remember to bring it back to how it works with Druid and helps people achieve even cooler things.

### Share challenges

Community events are the perfect place to get in front of a whiteboard and talk through how Druid can be applied to solve a problem, or how you solved a problem with Druid!

Feel good about sharing roadblocks you hit and how you worked around them, and always include time in your slot for Q&A.

### Show and tell

Everyone loves a demo! And we love demos that come before the slideware! Think about doing something live (or narrated over a recording) that showcases your work.

### Watch the Clock

If you run over, then the next will, and so on. Eventually the event is completely off schedule, and someone's talk may be cut short! Practice your presentation ahead of time to make sure you stay within your allotted time.

### Promote it

Always work with the meetup organizer themselves to work out how and when to promote your speaking slot and the event in general. Organizers have a vision in mind of how they want to drive attendance, and you're nearly always going to get better results working with them on how and when to let people know.
