# Apache Druid Community Event Guidance

Community events bring people together. They are a platform for sharing knowledge, discussing best practices, fostering collaboration, and enabling contributions.

This guide is intended to help organizers and speakers create inclusive, informative, and engaging Apache community events — whether virtual or in-person, for 10 attendees or 10,000 — in line with the values of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) and the broader open-source community.

## Guidance for organizers

### ASF rules take precedence

Review the ASF's [trademark policy](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/) to ensure compliance. Here are some important takeaways:

* Clearly indicate that your event is community-driven and not an official ASF event.
* Seek approval when the event name or primary branding features [Apache Druid](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/events#events).
* [Refer to Apache marks, projects, and products](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/events#naming) appropriately in materials, and include a clear attribution statement.
* Only ever use the Apache Druid logo to [refer to Apache Druid itself](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/events#graphics).
* Always check for [conflicts](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/events#dates) with other Apache events.

### Reach out to the PMC

It’s a standard practice for organizers of Apache-related events to connect with the project PMCs.

* Reach out to the PMC using teh Apache Druid dev-list.

* Work with a local PMC member who can [represent the Apache Druid project](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/events#selection) (not their employer), making sure that your event aligns with the project’s mission and policies.

### Think outside the Druid box

As an organizer of an Apache Druid meetup, you'll be playing a part of a bigger movement that's full of cool and superb people! Take note of the ecosystem around Apache Druid - you'll be fostering connections across the technoscape!

* [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/community/)
* [Apache Calcite](https://calcite.apache.org/community/)
* [Apache Datasketches](https://datasketches.apache.org/docs/Community)
* [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/what-is-flink/community/)
* [Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/community/)
* [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/contact)
* [Apache NiFi](https://nifi.apache.org/community/)
* [Apache Presto](https://prestodb.io/community/)
* [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/community/)
* [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/community.html)
* [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/community/)
* [Apache Zookeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/)

Remember that the focus of the event remains Apache Druid, so guide speakers to talk about how their technology relates to and works with Apache Druid.

### Educate, educate, educate

Lean into [providing education](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/events#education) about Apache Druid, rather than filling your diary with cool presentations about use cases.

* Look for speakers who can make conceptual designs real for people, with code samples, scripts, etc. that people can apply.
* Remember Druid extensions: you may find people who have created - or want to create - their own extensions.
* Encourage speakers to provide signposts to resources that allow your audience to apply what they have been shown.
* Balance your agenda or your event program to cater to both newcomers and experienced users.
* Think about having time set aside for breakouts and discussions, giving attendees space to engage in discussions, to ask questions, and to share their own perspectives.

### Select speakers based on merit

It can be very tempting to invite (or accept!) speakers because they're a big draw or have something cool to say. Or maybe they're promising to buy everyone who comes along a new car! But resist the temptation: as an organizer, it's your responsibility to put the Druid community first, not the speaker.

* Consider having multiple organizers so you can reach consensus when making decisions, including that all-important PMC member. This is an absolute requirement for events with over 100 expected attendees.
* Invite and accept speaker submissions based on their merit.

> Merit [lies with the individual](https://www.apache.org/theapacheway/#what-makes-the-apache-way-so-hard-to-define), does not expire, and is not influenced by employment status or employer.
> 
> Individuals participate at the Apache Software Foundation, not organizations. Domain expertise is appreciated; Benevolent Dictators For Life are disallowed.

Be transparent and accountable in your decision making. Think about how you'll keep and share records of what was decided, and what and who influenced the decision. For example, be ready to give feedback to speakers who weren't accepted, and to respond to queries from the PMC and the ASF.

### #include \<everyone\>

The PMC and all committers are passionate about building an inclusive and diverse community.

* All Apache Druid Meetups must respect and enforce the Apache [anti-harassment policy](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/events#anti-harassment). Everyone involved, including hosts, speakers, and attendees, must uphold and apply the policy.
* Put aside time and effort to bring in and coach speakers and attendees that might otherwise feel excluded or disadvantaged in the data community.
* Plan ahead to make accomodations for people with disabilities.

### Be a mentor

The ASF emphasizes the importance of mentoring people, helping them make their first contribution.

You can help by making a special effort to find and coach first-time speakers in the community, giving them an opportunity to grow by giving back.

### Give it some Slack!

The community mailing lists and Slack channel are a great place to connect with the PMC, to find local community members, to find out what would interest people, and to bring together your plan for your event.

Feel welcome to share details of your event, the time, date, and location, and about the topics and speakers.

Help speakers promote their talks and your event, giving them guidance on how and when to promote. Keep your vision in mind, and work with them to drive attendance.

Never spam.

### Record and share sessions

Recording and sharing event content can significantly extend the reach and impact of your sessions, allowing community members to access knowledge even if they couldn’t attend in real-time. However, it’s crucial to balance this with privacy considerations and compliance with regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Before recording, ensure that all participants — especially speakers and attendees who may appear in the video — are informed and have given their consent. Provide clear opt-out options for those who prefer not to be recorded, such as designated no-recording areas for in-person events or the ability to disable video participation in virtual events.

With each speaker's permission, think about how and where you might publish the content and create buzz after all the pizza boxes are in the recycling...

## Guidance for speakers

### Be a speaker, not a seller
The best meetups are where people learn and see what they can do thanks to the FOSS movement. They are not a place to find suspects, prospects, or to update customers for commercial products - nor are they the place to say that your solution is the best, and everyone else is the worst!

Just like the Apache Software Foundation itself, Druid events must be [vendor neutral](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/#rationale).

Amongst other things:

* Content which is solely focused on promotion of a product or service is never permitted at an Apache Druid event.
* It’s okay to mention and show commercial products when they are a key part of your Apache Druid-powered solution, but - because you're an educator! - it must always work with a truly free version of the commercial product.
* Attendees must never feel compelled to provide their personal data for pipeline generation.
* Let your company's technical expertise and integrity shine through your speaker: Druid events aren't a place for reciting battle cards or to have your speaker trained up and ready to go with objection handling narratives.

### Respect the part we all play

Never claim to be the [sole or exclusive leaders](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/events#events) of the Apache Druid project, nor the sole source of information. And never imply ownership, endorsement, or sponsorship of any ASF-related project or initiative of any kind.

> "No organization is able to gain special privileges or control a project’s direction, irrespective of employing Committers to work on Apache projects or sponsorship status."

> "Benevolent Dictators For Life are [disallowed](https://www.apache.org/theapacheway/#important)."

Never leave your audience believing that, somehow, you are speaking on behalf of the project or its community. Instead of saying something like, "in two years time, we will have support for ingestion from AcmeSQLDB," make a distinction between you / your team and the project: "the team here at Mafflin, Mifflin, Mofflin, and Mufflin are working on ingestion into Apache Druid from AcmeSQLDB! And we plan to contribute that to open source in the next two years."

When you use the Apache Druid logo or name (or any Apache marks) make sure your audience won't get confused between Apache projects and someone else's products or service. For example, don't mix and match corporate logos on the same slides.

### Respect the family

Keep your talk unbiased and educational. Engineers who create open source software - whoever they are - are our friends!

* Never disparage the ASF, its projects, members, sponsors, or communities - whether that's in your talk or in how you reply to questions.

* Stay objective, accurate, and honest by relying on your technical skill and knowledge. 

#### Not good

* "Oh yeah, we tried MofflinMofflinDB and all my team said it was AWFUL!").

* A talk entitled, "just how bad is MufflinTSDB compared to Apache Druid?!"

#### Much better

* MifflinMifflinDB has a centralized PotatoMasher process, while Apache Druid has a pool of StarchCompressor processes that handle things differently.

### Stay on topic

The focus of your talk must be Apache Druid.

Sharing technical information about another technology is not just awesome education, it's also sometimes necessary to give context.  Just remember to bring it back to how it works with Druid and helps people achieve even cooler things.

### Share challenges

Community events are the perfect place to get in front of a whiteboard and talk through how Druid can be applied to solve a problem, or how you solved a problem with Druid!

Feel good about sharing roadblocks you hit and how you worked around them, and always include time in your slot for Q&A.

### Show and tell

Everyone loves a demo ... especially when they come before the slideware! Think about doing something live (or narrated over a recording) that showcases your work.

### Watch the Clock

If you run over, then the next will, and so on. Eventually the event is completely off schedule, and someone's talk may be cut short! Practice your presentation ahead of time to make sure you stay within your allotted time.
