## Druid Community Meetups

Check out [Apache Druid on meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/topics/apache-druid/) for links to meetups in cities all over the world.

All Apache Druid Meetups subject to the Apache [anti-harassment policy](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/events#anti-harassment) and speakers are expected to follow the guidelines below.

### Speaker Guidelines

**Skip the Sales Pitch:** Keep your talk unbiased and educational. It’s okay to mention commercial products you’re using, but only if they are a key part of your data architecture and Apache Druid or if what you are demonstrating can be accomplished with a free or free tier version of the commercial product or service. Content which is solely focused on promotion of a product or service is never permitted at an Apache Druid Meetup.

**Share Challenges:**  Feel good about sharing roadblocks you hit and how you worked around them – or ones you might still be struggling with – there may be a community member in the audience who can help you out! Engineering always involves trade-offs, so being realistic about them helps establish you as a credible advisor.

**Focus on the Technical:** This audience understands and has built data architectures – if you get it, they’ll get it. Of course, start with the basics of who you are, what you built, and why before going all-in on the technical insights, examples, and demos.

**Keep an open mind:** The Apache Druid project has [a vendor neutrality policy](https://community.apache.org/projectIndependence#:~:text=Apache%20projects%20are%20managed%20independently) because it is important to keep an open mind about approaches and not only share one product or solution when many are available. A community that obviously favors one specific vendor in some exclusive way will often discourage new contributors from competing vendors, and this would be an issue for the long-term health of the project.

**Show and Tell:** If you can, prepare a short demo to accompany your presentation to showcase your work. This will help put everything in context for your fellow developers and the more visual learners in the audience.

**Watch the Clock:** If you run over, then the next will, and so on, until we’re either completely off schedule or someone else’s talk gets cut short!  Practice your presentation ahead of time to make sure you stay within your allotted time.
