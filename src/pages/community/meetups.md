## Druid Community Meetups

Check out [Apache Druid on meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/topics/apache-druid/) for links to meetups in cities all over the world.

All Apache Druid Meetups subject to the Apache [anti-harassment policy](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/events#anti-harassment) and speakers are expected to follow the guidelines below.

### Speaker Guidelines

**Skip the Sales Pitch:** Keep your talk unbiased and educational. It’s okay to mention commercial products you’re using only when they are a key part of your data architecture with Apache Druid, or your demonstration can work with a free or free tier version of the commercial product or service. Content which is solely focused on promotion of a product or service is never permitted at an Apache Druid Meetup.

**Share Challenges:** Feel good about sharing roadblocks you hit and how you worked around them – or ones you might still be struggling with. There may be a community member in the audience who can help you out! Engineering always involves trade-offs, so acknowledging your challenges helps establish you as a credible advisor.

**Focus on the Technical:** This audience understands and has built data architectures. If you get it, they’ll get it. Of course, start with the basics of who you are, what you built, and why. Then go all-in on the technical insights, examples, and demos.

**Keep an open mind:** The Apache Druid project has [a vendor neutrality policy](https://community.apache.org/projectIndependence#:~:text=Apache%20projects%20are%20managed%20independently) because it is important to keep an open mind about different ways to solve problems. A community that obviously favors one specific vendor in some exclusive may discourage new contributors from competing vendors, potentially impacting the long-term health of the project.

**Show and Tell:** If you can, prepare a short demo to accompany your presentation to showcase your work. This add context for your fellow developers and the more visual learners in the audience.

**Watch the Clock:** If you run over, then the next will, and so on. Eventually the Meetup is completely off schedule , meaning someone's talk may be cut short! Practice your presentation ahead of time to make sure you stay within your allotted time.
